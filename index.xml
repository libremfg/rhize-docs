It unites data analysis, event monitoring, and process execution in one platform. Its interface and architecture is designed to conform to your processes. We assume nothing about what your manufacturing workflows look like.
Rhize has only one strong opinion: all data exchanged must be modeled on the ISA-95 standard. This standards-based schema is how Rhize connects every data event across an entire operation.</description></item><item><title>Create objects from the UI</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/how-to/model/create-objects-ui/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 15:36:03 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/how-to/model/create-objects-ui/</guid><description>To make a production object visible to the Rhize data hub, you must define it as a data model. Along with its API, Rhize also has a graphical interface to create and update objects in your role-based equipment hierarchy.
Often, one object references another: for example, a piece of equipment may belong to an equipment class, have a unit of measure as a property, and be associated with process segment. These associations form nodes and edges in your knowledge graph, so the more information relationships that you accurately create, the better.</description></item><item><title>Overview</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/deploy/install/overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/deploy/install/overview/</guid><description>This guide walks you through how to Install Rhize and its services in a Kubernetes environment. You can also use these docs to model automation workflows in your CI.
This procedure aims to be as generic and vendor-neutral as possible. Some configuration depends on where and how you run your IT infrastructure—what cloud provider you use, preferred auxiliary tools, and so on&amp;mdash;so your team must adapt the process for its particular use cases.</description></item><item><title>Set up Kubernetes</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/deploy/install/setup-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 14:49:53 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/deploy/install/setup-kubernetes/</guid><description>This guide shows you how to install Rhize services on your Kubernetes cluster. You can also use this procedure as the model for an automation workflow in your CI.
Prerequisites Before starting, ensure that you have the following technical requirements.
Software requirements:
kubectl Helm Curl, or some similar program to make HTTP requests from the command line Access requirements:
Administrative privileges for a running Kubernetes cluster in your environment. Your organization must set this up.</description></item><item><title>3.0.0rc06</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/releases/3-0-0rc06/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 21:07:43 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/releases/3-0-0rc06/</guid><description>Release notes for version 3.0.0rc06 of the Rhize application.

To make these relations explorable, Rhize stores data in a special-purpose graph database designed to represent all levels of the manufacturing process. This database is enforced by our ISA-95 schema, the most comprehensive data representation of ISA-95 in the world.
Rhize exposes this database through a GraphQL API. Unlike REST, GraphQL requires only one endpoint, and you can define exactly the data that you return for each operation.</description></item><item><title>Master definitions and fields</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/how-to/model/master-definitions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 16:29:21 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/how-to/model/master-definitions/</guid><description>To make a production object visible to the Rhize data hub, you must define it as a data model.
These sections document all the objects that you can add through the UI, and the fields and properties that you can associate with them. All these models are based on the ISA-95 standard, mostly from Part 2, which describes the role-based equipment hierarchy.

To make these concepts more concrete, the final section provides examples of each process.
The heart of the Rhize platform is its manufacturing knowledge graph, which stores data from all levels of the operation and exposes this data through a single endpoint. Around the database are services that exchange messages and process events in real-time.</description></item><item><title>Query, mutate, and subscribe</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/how-to/gql/query-mutate-subscribe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/how-to/gql/query-mutate-subscribe/</guid><description>This document provides examples for how to use the Rhize GraphQL API to query, update, and subscribe to objects in the Manufacturing data hub.
In GraphQL, an operation is a type of request to the server. Rhize supports three types of operations:
Queries return data and subsets of data. Mutations change the data on the server side. Subscriptions notify about data changes in real time. Queries Most queries start with these three verbs, each of which indicates the resources to return.</description></item><item><title>Restore Grafana</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/deploy/restore/grafana/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 13:52:23 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/deploy/restore/grafana/</guid><description>This guide shows you how to restore Grafana in your Rhize environment.

Rhize BPMN elements are based on the Business Process Model and Notation OMG Standard. While the visual grammar is functionally the same, we extend some elements for specific Rhize features, like service tasks that call the GraphQL API.
Each BPMN workflow is a process with an ID. Each process is made up events (circles), activities (rectangles), gateways (diamonds), and flows (arrows).</description></item><item><title>BPMN execution recovery</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/deploy/restore/bpmn-nodes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/deploy/restore/bpmn-nodes/</guid><description>BPMN processes often have longer execution durations and many steps. If a BPMN node suddenly fails (for example through a panic or loss of power), Rhize needs to ensure that the workflow completes.
To achieve high availability and resiliency, Rhize services run in Kubernetes nodes, and the NATS message broker typically has data replication. As long as the remaining BPMN nodes are not already at full processing capacity, if a BPMN node fails while executing a process, the Rhize system recovers and finishes the workflow.</description></item><item><title>Default local ports</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/default-ports/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 16:49:42 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/default-ports/</guid><description>After you install Rhize services, they are accessible, by default, on the following ports:

It works by connecting to equipment or groups of equipment that run over protocols such as OPC UA.
As the communication bridge between the Rhize Data Hub and your plant, the agent has multiple functions:
It subscribes to tags and republishes the changes in NATS. It creates an interface for the BPMN engine to send reads and writes to a data source and its associated equipment.</description></item><item><title>Glossary</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/glossary/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 19:35:35 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/glossary/</guid><description>The manufacturing industry has many specialized terms—and many abbreviations. This glossary is a reference of how Rhize defines terms used in this documentation.
Agent The Rhize agent bridges your plant processes with the Rhize data hub. It collects data that is emitted during the manufacturing process and publishes it to the NATS message broker. Andon A system that alerts manufacturing teams about problems in processes or quality. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) A standardized graphical notation used to represent business processes in an intuitive, visual way Catch event In BPMN, a catch event reacts to a trigger (compared to a throw event, which returns some result).</description></item><item><title>About OpenID connect</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/deploy/about-openidconnect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/deploy/about-openidconnect/</guid><description>Rhize uses OpenIDConnect to connect to a Keycloak server to authenticate users and manage Role-based access controls.
Open ID Connect is a security architecture that uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to access secured resources. JWTs are issued by KeyCloak. Users can also be managed in KeyCloak. Or you can manage users in other services such as LDAP, Google, Azure AD, Facebook, etc.
The general authentication flow is as follows:
When a user accesses the user interface, the UI redirects to Keycloak.</description></item><item><title>Track changes (CDC)</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/how-to/publish-subscribe/track-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/how-to/publish-subscribe/track-changes/</guid><description>You can use change data capture (CDC) to track data changes over time, including mutations and drops in your database. Rhize&amp;rsquo;s CDC implementation can use Kafka, Nats or a local file as a sink to store CDC updates streamed by Rhize&amp;rsquo;s Alpha leader nodes.
When CDC is enabled, Rhize streams events for:
All set and delete mutations, except those that affect password fields Drop events. Live Loader events are recorded by CDC, but Bulk Loader events aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item></channel></rss>

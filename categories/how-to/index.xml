Along with its API, Rhize also has a graphical interface to create and update objects in your role-based equipment hierarchy.
Often, one object references another: for example, a piece of equipment may belong to an equipment class, have a unit of measure as a property, and be associated with process segment. These associations form nodes and edges in your knowledge graph, so the more information relationships that you accurately create, the better.</description></item><item><title>Overview</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/install/overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/install/overview/</guid><description>This guide walks you through how to Install Rhize and its services in a Kubernetes environment. You can also use these docs to model automation workflows in your CI.
This procedure aims to be as generic and vendor-neutral as possible. Some configuration depends on where and how you run your IT infrastructureâ€”what cloud provider you use, preferred auxiliary tools, and so on&amp;mdash;so your team must adapt the process for its particular use cases.</description></item><item><title>Connect data source</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/publish-subscribe/connect-datasource/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 14:50:39 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/publish-subscribe/connect-datasource/</guid><description>For Rhize to listen to and handle manufacturing events, you need to connect a data source.
Prerequisites To add a data source, you need the following:
Access to an MQTT or OPC UA server Credentials for this server, if necessary The URL and connection string for this server (Rhize will point to this) Steps to connect The process has two sides:
Sending topics from your MQTT, OPCUA, or NATS server to Rhize.</description></item><item><title>Overview: orchestrate processes</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/create-workflow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/create-workflow/</guid><description>This guide provides a quick overview of the major features of the Rhize BPMN engine and interface, with links to detailed guides for specific topics. For a reference of all BPMN elements and their parameters, refer to BPMN elements.
The Rhize BPMN UI provides a graphical interface to transform and standardize data flows across systems. Such process orchestration has many uses for manufacturing. For example, you can write a BPMN workflow to do any of the following:</description></item><item><title>Set up Kubernetes</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/install/setup-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 14:49:53 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/install/setup-kubernetes/</guid><description>This guide shows you how to install Rhize services on your Kubernetes cluster.

To make these relations explorable, Rhize stores data in a special-purpose graph database designed to represent all levels of the manufacturing process. This database is enforced by our ISA-95 schema, the most comprehensive data representation of ISA-95 in the world.
Rhize exposes this database through a GraphQL API. Unlike REST, GraphQL requires only one endpoint, and you can define exactly the data that you return for each operation.</description></item><item><title>Back up the Graph DB</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/backup/graphdb/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 11:01:46 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/backup/graphdb/</guid><description>This guide shows you how to back up the Rhize Graph database. You can also use it to model an automation workflow.
Prerequisites Before you start, ensure you have the following:
A designated backup location, for example ~/rhize-backups/database. Access to your Rhize Kubernetes Environment Optional: kubectx utilities kubectx to manage multiple clusters kubens to switch between and configure namespaces easily Optional: the k8 Lens IDE, if you prefer to use Kubernetes graphically.</description></item><item><title>Configure Keycloak</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/install/keycloak/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/install/keycloak/</guid><description>Rhize uses Keycloak as an OpenID provider. In your cluster, the Keycloak server to authenticate users, services, and manage Role-based access controls.
This topic describes how to set up Keycloak in your Rhize cluster. For a conceptual overview of the authentication flow, read About OpenID Connect
Prerequisites First, ensure that you have followed the instructions from Set up Kubernetes. All prerequisites for that step apply here.
Steps Follow these steps to configure a Keycloak realm and associate Rhize services to Keycloak clients, groups, roles, and policies.</description></item><item><title>Install Rhize services</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/install/services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/install/services/</guid><description>The final installation step is to install the Rhize services in your Kubernetes cluster.

The best choice of trigger depends on the context of the event and the system that initiates the workflow.
API triggers come from a GraphQL call to the Rhize DB. Message triggers subscribe to a topic on the Rhize broker and run whenever an event is published to that topic. Rule triggers subscribe to the topics on a remote data source, such as an edge OPC-UA server or MQTT broker.</description></item><item><title>Use JSONata</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/use-jsonata/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 16:20:35 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/use-jsonata/</guid><description>JSONata is a query language to filter, transform, and create JSON objects. Rhize BPMN workflows use JSONata expressions to transform JSON payloads as they pass through workflow nodes and across integrated systems. In BPMN workflows, JSONata expressions have some essential functions:
Map data. Moving values from one data structure to another. Calculate data. Receiving values as input and create new data from them. Create logical conditions. Generate values to feed to gateways to direct the flow of the BPMN.</description></item><item><title>Write BPMN workflows</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 14:50:39 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/</guid><description>In the following topics, learn how to use Rhize&amp;rsquo;s BPMN engine to orchestrate processes.

These guides show you how to back up different services and data on Rhize. They also serve as blueprints for automation.
Your organization must determine how frequently you backup services, and how long you store them for. The correct practice here is highly contextual, depending on the size of the data, the importance of the data, and the general regulatory and governance demands of your industry.</description></item><item><title>Restore</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/restore/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 19:35:35 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/restore/</guid><description>These guides show you how to restore data from backup. They also serve as blueprints for automation.
Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t need to restore data, it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice to test restoration periodically.</description></item><item><title>Query</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/gql/query/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/gql/query/</guid><description>A query returns one or more resources from the database. Whether you want to investigate manufacturing processes or build a custom report, a good query is likely the foundation of your workflow.
Most queries start with these three verbs, each of which indicates the resources to return.
get for a single resource query for multiple resources aggregate for calculations on arrays Note These operations correspond to the Get verb defined in Part 5 of the ISA-95 standard.</description></item><item><title>Filter</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/gql/filter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/gql/filter/</guid><description>Filters limit an operation to a subset of resources. You can use filters to make operations more precise, remove unneeded items from a payload, and reduce the need for secondary processing.
To use a filter, specify it in the operation&amp;rsquo;s argument. Most fields in an object can serve as a filter. Note This page provides a detailed guide of how to use the filters, with examples. For a bare reference of filters and data types, refer to the GraphQL type reference.</description></item><item><title>Handle errors and debug</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/debug-workflows/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 19:35:09 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/debug-workflows/</guid><description>Errors come in two categories: expected and unexpected. The Rhize BPMN engine has ways to handle both.
A robust workflow should have built-in logic to anticipate errors. For unexpected issues, Rhize also creates a trace for each workflow, which you can use to observe the behavior and performance of the workflow at each element as it executes sequentially. You can also use debug flags and variables to trace variable context as it transforms across the workflow.</description></item><item><title>Maintain</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/maintain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 19:35:35 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/maintain/</guid><description>Maintenance is critical to ensure reliability over time.
These guides show you how to maintain different services and data on Rhize. They also serve as blueprints for automation.
Your organization must determine how you maintain your services, and how often you archive or remove data. The correct practice here is highly contextual, depending on the size of the data, the importance of the data, and the general regulatory and governance demands of your industry.</description></item><item><title>Mutate</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/gql/mutate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/gql/mutate/</guid><description>Mutations change the database in someway by creating, updating, or deleting a resource. You might use a mutation to update a personnel class, or in to a BPMN workflow that automatically creates records of incoming material lots.
Rhize supports the following ways to change the API.
add Note The add operation corresponds to the Process verb defined in Part 5 of the ISA-95 standard. Mutations that start with add create a resource on the server.</description></item><item><title>Subscribe</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/gql/subscribe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/gql/subscribe/</guid><description>The operations for a subscription are similar to the operations for a query. But rather than providing information about the entire item, the purpose of subscriptions is to notify about real-time changes to a manufacturing resource.
Note These operations correspond to the SyncGet verb defined in Part 5 of the ISA-95 standard. This example query subscribes to changes in a specified set of workResponses, reporting only their id and effective end time.</description></item><item><title>Archive the PostgreSQL Audit trail</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/maintain/audit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 11:20:56 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/maintain/audit/</guid><description>The audit trial can generate a high volume of data, so it is a good practice to periodically archive portions of it. An archive separates a portion of the data from the database and keeps it for long-term storage. This process involves the use of PostgreSQL Table Partitions.
Archiving a partition improves query speed for current data, while providing a cost-effective way to store older.
Prerequisites Before you start, ensure you have the following:</description></item><item><title>Back up Audit PostgreSQL</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/backup/audit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 11:20:56 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/backup/audit/</guid><description>This guide shows you the procedure to backup your Audit PostgreSQL database on your Rhize Kubernetes deployment.

Manufacturing events can generate a vast amount of data. And a BPMN workflow can have any number of logical flows and data transformations. So an inefficient BPMN process can introduce performance degradations.
Manage the process context size Note The max size of the process variable context comes from the default max payload size of NATS Jetstreams. To increase this size, change your NATS configuration.</description></item><item><title>Back up Keycloak</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/backup/keycloak/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 14:30:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/backup/keycloak/</guid><description>This guide shows you how to back up Keycloak on your Rhize Kubernetes deployment.

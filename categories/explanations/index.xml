&lt;p>This article explains what the components of a &lt;em>Manufacturing Data Hub&lt;/em> (MDH) are and why the system must have these particular components to meet the needs of large, modern manufacturing environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In another phrasing, this article explains why Rhize made the choices it did to become the world&amp;rsquo;s first manufacturing data hub.
For introductory explanations about Rhize in particular,
read &lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/get-started/introduction/" >What is Rhize?&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/get-started/how-rhize-works/" >How Rhize works&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>What is an MDH?&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="what-is-an-mdh">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#what-is-an-mdh" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A manufacturing data hub is a system that collects all manufacturing events, stores them in a standard model, and has a programmable engine that can run user logic to receive, transform, and send messages across different devices in a manufacturing operation.
As it comes with all the necessary backend components—message handling, logic, and storage—an MDH also serves as a backend for manufacturers to build custom MES and MOM applications.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3>Components&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="components">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#components" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>An MDH is not only a storage or message system.
It is a coherent system of interrelated parts and interfaces whose components include the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A high-performance graph database with a standardized schema&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A data model based on manufacturing standards&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An API to interact with the data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An agent that listens for tag changes from data sources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A rules engine that monitors tag changes and triggers user workflows when conditions are met&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A message broker that communicates events to and from various systems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A workflow engine that processes, transforms, and contextualizes tag and event data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The IT infrastructure that this all runs on, which at a certain scale must be clustered.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3>Technical requirements&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="technical-requirements">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#technical-requirements" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Besides its components and features, Rhize is also explicitly designed to meet the needs of a manufacturing operation of any scale.
This goal requires a high standard of operational performance, robustness, and extensibility:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Zero Downtime Architecture.&lt;/strong> A data hub such as Rhize is used in mission-critical environments that run every hour of every day. Outages are unacceptable. Operators must be able to update every component of the system without taking it offline.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Secure.&lt;/strong> Users must be able to securely access and integrate with the hub across applications in the enterprise. So the database requires native &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OAuth2&lt;/a> security integration for seamless single-sign-on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ACID-compliant.&lt;/strong> The critical features of an MES require the guarantee of an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACID&lt;/a> database. Consistency and availability must be maintained even as the system scales horizontally.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Headless operation.&lt;/strong> Users must be able to use the data hub as a backend to run MES functions, using frameworks or low-code tools to build any frontend on top of these functions. This flexibility is how the MDH can adapt to any manufacturing process: Rhize provides the means to store, standardize, and handle information flows; users build on top of this backend to create the applications, workflows, and interfaces that make sense for their use cases.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Type-safe.&lt;/strong> Uncontrolled schemas in messages become brittle at scale. Unlike a pure MQTT architecture, which does not check the schema of message payloads, the MDH must enforce that data has a standard structure at the moment that the data is written to the database.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Extensible but Standardized.&lt;/strong> While the data hub is built on the ISA-95 standard, it must be able to extend to include customer-specific schemas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Process orchestration.&lt;/strong> The hub must be able to coordinate tasks handled by multiple systems concurrently and provide a way for users to automate and combine workflows.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2>Why an MDH needs this design&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="why-an-mdh-needs-this-design">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#why-an-mdh-needs-this-design" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Rhize chose its components deliberately, after careful consideration and years of real-world experience.
The following sections describe how these components work together and how this design arose from the landscape of manufacturing automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Point-to-point reaches scaling issues&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="point-to-point-reaches-scaling-issues">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#point-to-point-reaches-scaling-issues" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In early efforts to digitize manufacturing, information often flows from &lt;em>point to point&lt;/em>.
Each node in the system communicates directly with the other nodes that it sends data to or receives data from.
While this form of communication is initially simple to implement, it also tightly couples services.
As the system scales, the complexity of point-to-point communication increases non-linearly. With each node, the system becomes increasingly fragile and unobservable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, notice how many channels of communication are maintained in this stylized diagram of information
exchange between level-three and level-four systems in a point-to-point topology:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="big-figure">

&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption class="caption">

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3>Pub/sub messaging decouples devices&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="pubsub-messaging-decouples-devices">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#pubsub-messaging-decouples-devices" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>When point-to-point communication becomes too difficult to maintain, the &lt;em>hub-and-spoke&lt;/em> approach presents the logical next step.
In this topology, a central hub coordinates communication between nodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some systems achieve a hub and spoke through &lt;em>polling&lt;/em>,
where each device sends a request to the hub at some interval to check whether resources changed.
However, considering the number of devices and volume of exchange in manufacturing,
polling can create a massive amount of unnecessary traffic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of polling, &lt;em>the publish-subscribe pattern&lt;/em> can be a more efficient way to decouple communication.
Event producers &lt;em>publish&lt;/em> topics to a message broker, and the message broker sends the event to consumers that &lt;em>subscribe&lt;/em> to the particular topic.
With the proliferation of IoT devices and the popularity of the MQTT protocol, publish-subscribe messaging has gained widespread adoption in manufacturing.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="big-figure">
&lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/images/arch/diagram-rhize-pubsub-hubspoke.png" target="_blank">
&lt;img src="https://docs.rhize.com/images/arch/diagram-rhize-pubsub-hubspoke.png" alt="Diagram showing event producers and subscribers in decoupled pub-sub communication"
width="65%"
>
&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption class="caption">
Diagram showing event producers and subscribers in decoupled pub-sub communication
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>While publish-subscribe patterns resolve issues of coupled communication and data accessibility,
they don&amp;rsquo;t address how to make this data useful:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How can users collect and organize the data for analysis?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can this data drive further automation?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>An operation with many data sources likely also has many different structures of its in-flight messages.
The MQTT format, for example, has no prescribed payload format: structured JSON and binary blobs are equally valid.
While such flexibility provides excellent convenience for producers, the lack of uniformity can make wider integration efforts convoluted and unmaintainable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The philosophy of a data hub is to address these problems without comprising flexibility.
So its central components, the database, schema, and message and event handlers,
can integrate disparate systems while providing a common, standardized storage for the data exchanged between these systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>A standard graph model provides context&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="a-standard-graph-model-provides-context">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#a-standard-graph-model-provides-context" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Every event, person, and object in a manufacturing system is inter-connected.
To adequately process incoming event data, manufacturers need to &lt;em>contextualize&lt;/em> it, where each event carries additional information about its context within the larger system.
This context is framed by the information &lt;em>model&lt;/em> that represents the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a coherent model of the system, manufacturers need to be able to store assets and event data according to a standardized schema.
To scale, this model needs to be suitably thorough and generic.
For any organization, it would be an enormous undertaking to write a bespoke model.
Fortunately, decades of collaboration have already generated a suitable standard: ISA-95.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="big-figure">
&lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/images/arch/diagram-rhize-isa95-schema.png" target="_blank">
&lt;img src="https://docs.rhize.com/images/arch/diagram-rhize-isa95-schema.png" alt="Diagram showing ISA-95 data model"
width="65%"
>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The ISA-95 standard provides a comprehensive data model for manufacturing.
As it happens, its object-oriented system of attributes and relations has an inherent graph structure.
This harmony of ISA-95 and graph structures makes a graph database a perfect foundation for the manufacturing data hub:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The schema provides the complete model, suitable to any scale&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The graph database provides the structure that coheres with the inter-related reality of manufacturing&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>However, while publish-subscribe messaging decouples communication, and the ISA-95 database provides a sensible way to contextualize the messages of this data,
the system still needs a bridge between the message stream and the long-term, standardized storage.
This gap reveals missing components:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The system needs to structure raw message data in its ISA-95 representation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Users need a way to access the database and message flow to program their own applications.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption class="caption">

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3>The rules engine creates events&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-rules-engine-creates-events">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-rules-engine-creates-events" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>After the hub receives a message, it must evaluate whether the data is significant enough to constitute an event.
This is the function of the &lt;em>rules engine&lt;/em>: it assesses message values for changes and then evaluates whether these values should be classified as significant &lt;em>events&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="big-figure">
&lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/images/arch/diagram-rhize-rule-engine.png" target="_blank">
&lt;img src="https://docs.rhize.com/images/arch/diagram-rhize-rule-engine.png" alt="Diagram showing how the rules engine turns topics into events."
width="65%"
>
&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption class="caption">
The rules converts significant values into manufacturing events.
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Once the system receives an event, users then need a way to be able to process it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>A workflow engine makes the system responsive&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="a-workflow-engine-makes-the-system-responsive">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#a-workflow-engine-makes-the-system-responsive" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>For true &amp;ldquo;ubiquitous automation&amp;rdquo; of manufacturing processes, an MDH must provide a way for users to write their own logic to handle events as they happen.
Thus, the hub needs a &lt;em>workflow engine&lt;/em> that can send messages, process data, and interact with the database in real-time.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="big-figure">
&lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/images/arch/diagram-rhize-bpmn-eda.png" target="_blank">
&lt;img src="https://docs.rhize.com/images/arch/diagram-rhize-bpmn-eda.png" alt="An example BPMN workflow that receives a job order, evaluates whether maintenance is needed, then stores the data in a standardized database"
width="70%"
>
&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption class="caption">
An example BPMN workflow that receives a job order, evaluates whether maintenance is needed, then stores the data in a standardized database
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The data hub also must be agnostic about the information it receives, so the event handler must have a way to transform incoming events and represent them in the database schema.
Without such transformation, the burden of ISA-95 standardization falls on the event producer.
This is both inconvenient for the user and more architecturally fragile:
a second place where transformation can happen is also a second point of failure.
As long as the producer and consumer can accept and receive the same encoding (for example, JSON), the data hub should be responsible for enforcing standardization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With components for data ingestion, processing, and standardized storage, the MDH has all the necessary functionality to serve as a knowledge graph, MES backend, and integrator of legacy systems.
However, this capability cannot be realized unless the system is usable for the widest range of people.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Sensible interfaces make it accessible&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="sensible-interfaces-make-it-accessible">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#sensible-interfaces-make-it-accessible" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>For many who work in industrial automation, IT is part of a job, not a job in itself.
So, a well-designed manufacturing data hub should provide high-quality abstractions
and interfaces that minimize the need for thinking about IT systems (instead of manufacturing ones).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GraphQL, with its single endpoint and precise controls, makes an ideal API interface for the MDH graph database.
Queries resemble the structure of the data itself, requiring no recursive joins or intermediary object-relation models.
GraphQL also pairs perfectly with a data model based on ISA-95, whose object model has a graph structure, itself a model of the interconnected reality of actual manufacturing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While GraphQL provides the API to query and transform the data, it cannot execute logic.
So, the rules engine should also provide a graphical interface to make event handling as accessible as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, one final piece is missing: the system must be robust enough for the data-intensive world of manufacturing IT.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Distributed execution provides robustness&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="distributed-execution-provides-robustness">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#distributed-execution-provides-robustness" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The final factor is that the components of an MDH must run on distributed systems.
Large manufacturing operations can generate enormous volumes of data.
At some point, scaling vertically (with better hardware on single devices) is impossible.
Besides size constraints, single devices also create single points of failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, an MDH must scale horizontally, where different nodes share computation responsibilities,
and extra volumes add data replication.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="#definition-demand-result" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>At a high-level, manufacturing consists of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Goods being demanded&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goods being produced&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Between these two points, the manufacturing operations performs this work according to its definitions
of work and the resources that it has available.
This diagram shows how ISA-95 defines these fundamental relationships from the perspective of the business (ERP) and manufacturing operation (MOM).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The design of the Rhize Manufacturing Data Hub comes from decades of work in industrial automation.
Rhize is designed to scale to the largest organizations, integrate with legacy systems, and address the complex reality of manufacturing head on.
These to do this, these are our explicit design goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li> Provide a highly reliable means to collect manufacturing data from varied sources.&lt;/li>
&lt;li> Standardize this data in a way that accurately places it within an &lt;em>event&lt;/em> in the context of an entire manufacturing operation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Offer a programmable engine to write custom logic to process the data and send it between systems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support being built on top of it, where Rhize serves as the backend for MES/MOM frontends.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Expose this system through an interface that is accessible to the widest number of stakeholders in the manufacturing operation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These following topics explain the concepts, architecture, and philosophy that underpin the Rhize application:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Equipment is an object that has a defined role in the production process.
Equipment can have &lt;em>properties&lt;/em>, which define some temporary or permanent value,
and can belong to &lt;em>classes&lt;/em>, which provide templates to define and categorize related objects.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>All the equipment entities are connected through relationships.
This page describes what these relationships are and when to use them.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2>The role-based hierarchy&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-role-based-hierarchy">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-role-based-hierarchy" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The word &lt;em>role&lt;/em> is key to understanding the ISA-95 equipment models.
All equipment has a particular function in the wider operation.
The scope of a role varies widely, from the execution of an enterprise-level schedule to the production of a single unit of material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Equipment with broader scopes occupy higher &lt;em>levels&lt;/em>,
and they may be composed of lower-level equipment objects that perform more specialized roles.
This composition of equipment is called
the &lt;em>role-based equipment hierarchy&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://docs.rhize.com/images/s95/diagram-rhize-isa95-equipment-hierarchy.svg"
alt="Role-based equipment hierarchy" width="65%">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Your model can be explicit about the equipment&amp;rsquo;s position in the hierarchy through the &lt;code>equipmentLevel&lt;/code> attribute.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="mermaid hx-mt-6">classDiagram
class equipment {
+ id = "JF.SF.PA.PackL4.Capper"
+ description: "Capper line 4"
+ equipmentLevel = "workUnit"
}&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Note that the lowest two levels distinguish equipment that has a storage role from equipment that has a production role.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When equipment has a production role, that role typically is scoped to the execution of an order or collection of orders.
For example, in our fictional juice factory, equipment roles include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Springfield plant. A site-level equipment that organizes the production of all brands of juice.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The sugar storage zone. Where the Springfield site stores raw sugar in silos.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The mixing unit. a work unit that receives raw coloring, flavoring, and sugar as input and produces a bulk volume of &lt;code>Cosmic Blue juice&lt;/code> material as input as output.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The role of work units, equipment on the lowest level, is typically to execute one order at a time.
For that reason, PLCs and other controls-level equipment is typically below the scope of the ISA-95 equipment model
—though &lt;strong>the model may provide an interface for PLC to level-3 interaction.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Equipment is made up of equipment&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="equipment-is-made-up-of-equipment">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#equipment-is-made-up-of-equipment" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Equipment is made up of other equipment.
High-level equipment items are composed of equipment items with more granular functions.
For example, the juice factory has a work center, &lt;code>packaging line 1&lt;/code>, that is composed of 4 lower level units that perform specific packaging functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="mermaid hx-mt-6">classDiagram
equipment o--> equipment : made up of&lt;/pre>&lt;h3>Reasons to use &lt;code>isMadeOf&lt;/code>&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="reasons-to-use-ismadeof">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#reasons-to-use-ismadeof" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The &lt;code>isMadeOf&lt;/code> relationship provides a way to organize equipment in its hierarchical structure.
This structure often mimics the spatial hierarchy of the plant or the social hierarchy of the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides this, the &lt;code>isMadeOf&lt;/code> relationship provides a way to do the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Set required assemblies for sub items&lt;/strong>. For example, a process specifies a &lt;code>Sweeteners storage center&lt;/code> it also logically specifies the equipment that that storage center contains (e.g. &lt;code>silos&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Query and compare work by zone of interest.&lt;/strong> For example, you could compare performance across all packing lines by querying the parent center.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Provide a view of the manufacturing operation that is intelligible from the business perspective.&lt;/strong>
The equipment model focuses on the production of new material, not individual controls.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3>Query example: full composition of The Juice Factory&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="query-example-full-composition-of-the-juice-factory">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#query-example-full-composition-of-the-juice-factory" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In the RhizeDB, the equipment &lt;code>isMadeUpOf&lt;/code> relationship can be queried as follows.

&lt;a href="#equipment-can-have-properties" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Properties are &lt;em>key value&lt;/em> pairs that report some permanent or temporary condition of an object.
Equipment can have 0 or many properties.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="mermaid hx-mt-6">classDiagram
equipment *--> `equipment property` :has values of&lt;/pre>&lt;p>For example, the &lt;code>Packaging line&lt;/code> work center has properties for &lt;code>State&lt;/code>, which reports whether the center is active or not.
The work units that store raw material all have &lt;code>allowedMaterialClass&lt;/code> property, which specifies what material can be stored.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Equipment properties can contain properties&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="equipment-properties-can-contain-properties">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#equipment-properties-can-contain-properties" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>A property itself can have a composition of properties.
For example, a unit might have the &lt;code>dimension&lt;/code> property that contains subproperties of &lt;code>width&lt;/code> and &lt;code>height&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="mermaid hx-mt-6">classDiagram
rectangularThing *--> `dimension (property)` : "has values of"
`dimension (property)` *--> length : "contains"
`dimension (property)` *--> width : "contains"
`dimension (property)` *--> height : "contains"&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This &lt;code>contains&lt;/code> relationship creates a container to group granular properties by some commonality.
It also saves configuration time, since any equipment that has the parent property can logically have its child properties as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Equipment classes define equipment&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="equipment-classes-define-equipment">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#equipment-classes-define-equipment" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Similar equipment might be &lt;em>defined&lt;/em> by its equipment class.
Classes minimize repetitive modelling of equal equipment and properties.&lt;/p>

equipment --> `equipment class` : defined by&lt;/pre>&lt;p>For example, the &lt;code>packing line&lt;/code> work center always has a &lt;code>filler&lt;/code> work unit as part of its composition.
So, when there are 4 &lt;code>packing lines&lt;/code>, there logically must be 4 fillers.
To avoid individually tracking each filler and its configuration, you can create a &lt;code>fillers&lt;/code> class that defines each member.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.isa.org/store?query=isa95" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISA-95&lt;/a> provides a common language to discuss manufacturing.
When you speak with other manufacturing stakeholders, you can use the standard&amp;rsquo;s precise vocabulary to ensure that everyone is speaking about the same thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The standard also describes how different manufacturing entities relate to each other.
&lt;a href="https://rhize.com/blog/reframing-perspective-on-isa95/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">With the right application architecture&lt;/a>,
these relationships can form a complete and coherent data model of a full manufacturing operation.
Thus learning how to speak the language of ISA-95 can help standardize communication between both humans and machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, while ISA-95 is not as complex as a natural human language, it is lengthy. This document provides a brief introduction to some essential terminology.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Foundational concepts&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="foundational-concepts">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#foundational-concepts" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The following concepts frame all conversation that involves ISA-95.
If you are a manufacturing veteran, they might be familiar to you.
But a high-level review never hurt anyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>The levels of a manufacturing operation&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-levels-of-a-manufacturing-operation">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-levels-of-a-manufacturing-operation" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

width="80%"
>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Discussions that involve ISA-95 frequently reference the &lt;em>levels&lt;/em> of a system.
You may hear phrases like &amp;ldquo;this workflow integrates level-4 data with level-3 activities,&amp;rdquo;
or &amp;ldquo;the batch is a level-3 construct&amp;rdquo;.
In this context, &lt;em>level&lt;/em> corresponds the degree of granularity necessary to discuss and exchange data for different purposes in the manufacturing operation.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Level&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Operational Perspective&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Example system&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>4&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Business planning&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;abbr title="Enterprise resource planning. Software to manage business processes. In Rhize, ERP activities usually are named &amp;#34;operations&amp;#34;, where lower-level activities are prefixed with &amp;#34;Work&amp;#34;.">ERP&lt;/abbr>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>3&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Manufacturing operations management&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;abbr title="Manufacturing execution system. A system in a manufacturing process that tracks and documents the transformation of raw materials to finished goods">MES&lt;/abbr>, &lt;abbr title="Computerized maintenance management system. A Source of information about an organization&amp;#39;s maintenance operations">CMMS&lt;/abbr>, Quality control&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Monitoring and acquisition&lt;/td>
&lt;td>SCADA&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>1&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Sensors&lt;/td>
&lt;td>PLCs&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>While &lt;strong>ISA-95 focuses on level 3 and the interaction between levels 3 and 4&lt;/strong>, your models can incorporate data from level 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Role based equipment hierarchy: the view from up top&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="rbeh">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#rbeh" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The &lt;em>equipment hierarchy&lt;/em> represents how equipment can contain other equipment, as a production line might contain a conveyor belt and a pneumatic actuator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ISA-95 defines equipment across multiple scales.
The scale may be as broad as the building where a plant makes items or as a granular as an individual unit that performs one small action within a complex process.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="big-figure">
&lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/images/s95/diagram-rhize-isa95-equipment-hierarchy.svg" target="_blank">
&lt;img src="https://docs.rhize.com/images/s95/diagram-rhize-isa95-equipment-hierarchy.svg" alt="Role-based equipment hierarchy"
width="65%"
>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>These equipment hierarchies often provide a naming convention to prefix addresses for plant data.
For example, an MQTT topic might be named &lt;code>site1/bakery2/kitchenA/ovens/a_temp_sensor&lt;/code>.
In Rhize, the &lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/model/master-definitions/" >Equipment UI&lt;/a> provides an interface to model your plant according to this compositional hierarchy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Relationships&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="relationships">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#relationships" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Most diagrams about models in ISA-95 show a collection of objects that are connected by lines and arrows.
These lines and arrows represent &lt;em>relationships&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understanding how entities relate is fundamental to understanding how to the manufacturing process works as a complete system.
Nothing in a manufacturing operation happens in a vacuum,
and ISA-95 describes these connections with a precise vocabulary of relation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some important relations include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Defined by&lt;/strong>. As a member may be defined by a class.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>References&lt;/strong> As an operations definition references a bill of material&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Assembled from&lt;/strong>. As a final material lot may be assembled from various intermediate lots.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Made up of&lt;/strong>. As work schedules are made up of work requests, and work centers are made up of work units.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For the full list of relationships, refer to ISA-95 Part 2.
To explore the relationships in an interactive way,
you can use the Rhize &lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/gql/" >GraphQL&lt;/a> API explorer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>The activities of an MES&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-activities-of-an-mes">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-activities-of-an-mes" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Much of the ISA-95 standard discusses operations at the view of level 3, that is the MES or &lt;em>Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM)&lt;/em> system. But what activities are part of a MOM system? This is the subject of ISA-95 Part 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="big-figure">

&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption class="caption">
Different activities of a level-3 system and their interactions with other levels. Broadly, activities can be categorized as reference, pre-execution, execution, and post-execution.
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The 8 major activities of a MOM are as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Product definition:&lt;/strong> What goes into a product, and what resources does it require?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Resource management:&lt;/strong> What resources are available to produce goods?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Detailed production scheduling:&lt;/strong> When and what does the business want to produce? After a business determines its demand, it can build a schedule using its available resources.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Production dispatching:&lt;/strong> How will the plant assign the available resources to produce the schedule? Once the schedule is received, the level-3 system can assign resources to orders by referencing the definitions and capabilities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Production execution management:&lt;/strong> How does the plant execute the order?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Production data collection:&lt;/strong> What data is emitted and stored during execution?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Production tracking:&lt;/strong> What components and actions went into production? For example, &lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/use-cases/ebr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EBR&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/use-cases/genealogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genealogy&lt;/a>, and Track and Trace are all use-cases of production tracking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Production performance analysis:&lt;/strong> How well did the actual production run go, as compared to its ideal? For example, measures of OEE, deviation analysis, and golden batches are all use-cases of performance analysis.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To make sense of these activities, you also need to have a concept of the relationship between planned and performed work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Definition, demand, result&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="definition-demand-result">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#definition-demand-result" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Almost all manufacturing processes share a common flow, from &lt;em>definition&lt;/em> to &lt;em>production&lt;/em> to &lt;em>analysis&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A business defines how a good is to be produced.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The business then creates a schedule that demands that a number of these goods are produced according to its definition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The plant uses its available resources and references the existing definitions to execute the orders from the schedule.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>As long as a business continues to make things, its processes always include a definition of work, a demand for work, and the result of production.
These categories inform not only the activities of manufacturing but also the models of production that make each of these activities sensible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Frequently used models&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="frequently-used-models">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#frequently-used-models" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>ISA-95 describes how production &lt;em>entities&lt;/em> relate to one another within and across the manufacturing activities.
Entities are physical or abstract objects that make up the composition of a manufacturing process in its past, present, future, and ideal state.
Here are some of the most common entities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>Resources&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="resources">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#resources" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>All aspects of manufacturing involve resources. Without resources nothing can be done or made. ISA-95 Parts 1 and 2 provide a rich and extensive vocabulary for discussing resources. Generally the resource models have the following patterns:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Classes&lt;/em> provide groupings and associations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The members of a class are objects that exist in the real world. These &lt;em>instances&lt;/em> are represented with versions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As the work executes, the &lt;em>actuals&lt;/em> define what resource was really used for a specific job.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These resources are part of specifications and requirements for definitions of work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All of these resource models can be extended with &lt;em>properties&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4>Equipment&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="equipment">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#equipment" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote> 🎥Watch:&lt;/span>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh6sYCuNYJI&amp;amp;list=PLeYowHxqJrUi5ojKBvYg3CnfYdvOqVMi5&amp;amp;index=1">Creating an equipment model in Rhize&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Equipment is an object that has a defined role in the production process.
Important equipment models include the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Equipment classes.&lt;/strong> Equipment that shares some purpose, such as &lt;code>rotating widget makers&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Equipment (Instance).&lt;/strong> An instance of an equipment class, such as &lt;code>compressor-5, version 2&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Actual.&lt;/strong> The equipment that really performed a job. For example, the actual could be the ID of the compressor involved in some specific production.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Equipment Properties.&lt;/strong> Attributes of an equipment or equipment class. For example, a property of an compressor might be &lt;code>rotation_speed&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Relationships between equipment are organized according to the role-based equipment hierarchy and, optionally, the hierarchy scope.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Material&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="material">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#material" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Material&lt;/em> is all the input matter required to produce a finished good.
Import material models include the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Material classes.&lt;/strong> Material classes represent a broad group of associated materials. An example might be &lt;code>raw_sugar&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Material definitions.&lt;/strong> A standardized definition of some material, ensuring consistency in the operation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Material lots.&lt;/strong> Material lots and sublots are the identifiable units that go into a larger assembly.
For example, a material lot might be a pallet of sugar from a supplier, and the sublot might be the individual sugar bags.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lots can have parent/child relationships to express material compositions.
The composition could be reversible, as in a machine assembled from interchangeable parts, or permanent, as in the case of a processes that involve one-way chemical transformations.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Material Actual.&lt;/strong> A material actual is the quantity of material in a job that is used, consumed, marked as scrap, and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Material properties.&lt;/strong> Properties of material that are relevant to the production process, for example, &lt;code>meltingPoint&lt;/code> or &lt;code>containsLactose&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4>Personnel&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="personnel">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#personnel" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>&lt;em>Personnel&lt;/em> are the people who execute a job.
Important personnel models include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Personnel class.&lt;/strong> A group of people with an associated function, for example &lt;code>coil_operators&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Person.&lt;/strong> The &amp;ldquo;instance&amp;rdquo; of a personnel class, where the &amp;ldquo;version&amp;rdquo; may track properties like certifications and years of experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Personnel actual.&lt;/strong> The people who really perform a certain job.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Personnel properties.&lt;/strong> Attributes such as &lt;code>trained to operate heavy machinery&lt;/code>. Properties could also communicate a person&amp;rsquo;s location or current assignment.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3>Hierarchy scope: multiple views of equipment hierarchies&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="hierarchy-scope-multiple-views-of-equipment-hierarchies">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#hierarchy-scope-multiple-views-of-equipment-hierarchies" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The hierarchy scope is a special grouping of equipment that does not necessarily follow the conventional role-based hierarchy.
For example, Rhize uses hierarchy scope to &lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/work-calendars/about-calendars-and-overrides/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> define calendar rules and calculate metrics &lt;/a>for a set of machines whose shift rules don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily correspond to the hierarchy. You might also set a hierarchy scope to calculate metrics or track production across an arbitrary grouping of equipment.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3>Segments: process steps to execute&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="segments-process-steps-to-execute">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#segments-process-steps-to-execute" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The process segment defines the unit of work as it is visible from the business.
For example, a baking operation may have the segments &lt;code>mixing&lt;/code>, &lt;code>baking&lt;/code>, &lt;code>cooling&lt;/code>, &lt;code>testing&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>storing&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A segment indicates that a unit of work is meaningful for the business to follow.
While &lt;code>mixing&lt;/code> might be example of a valid segment, an individual turn of the mixing motor would be a very unlikely segment, as the action is too granular to provide any useful context to the business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A segment may specify its necessary work definitions and resources.
Process segments also serve as information containers to analyze and track the production of a good at some stage in its lifecycle.&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption class="caption">
An operations schedule is associated with a work requests, which has associated job orders
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Besides resources, manufacturers also need to track and describe how work is demanded and performed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ISA-95 offers vocabulary to describe the views of this work from both the level-4 (business) perspective and the level 3 (execution) perspective.
If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering whether a model refers to level 3 or 4, keep this trick in mind:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Models that start with &amp;ldquo;operation&amp;rdquo; refer to level 4; models that start with &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; refer to level 3.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>The operational view of work&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-operational-view-of-work">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-operational-view-of-work" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In all conventional manufacturing, demand originates from the &amp;ldquo;top,&amp;rdquo; that is, from the business or level-4 system. Production results are compared against this original demand. Thus, all conventional models of manufacturing include a model of demand, definitions, and results from the level-4 perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This operational view of work is defined in ISA-95 Part 2.
Here is a quick primer on the major models:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Operations definitions&lt;/strong> define the resources required to perform a schedule.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Operations schedules&lt;/strong> include the &lt;em>requests&lt;/em> to produce goods.
These requests typically demand that production occur at certain times or by certain deadlines.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Operations performance&lt;/strong> is the collection of &lt;em>responses&lt;/em> to a request. Performance models provide information about the &lt;em>state&lt;/em> of a request, such as &lt;code>WAITING&lt;/code>, &lt;code>READY&lt;/code>, &lt;code>RUNNING&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>COMPLETED&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Operations capability&lt;/strong> provides information about the resources for past and future operations. These capability models provide a way to determine a plant&amp;rsquo;s theoretical maximum capacity and a way to analyze how well previous runs performed against this capacity.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3>The level-3 view of work&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-level-3-view-of-work">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-level-3-view-of-work" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>ISA-95 Part 4 defines the level-3 models of work. These models are more granular and detailed than their corresponding operational models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically, one operations request corresponds to one work request, and they differ in the degree of detail reported in the work request. For example, the operations request may ask for 1000 intermediate widgets, and the work request produces these intermediate widgets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, a work request may also fulfill multiple or even fractional operations requests―for example, a work request may produce 1500 intermediate widgets, allocating 1000 to fulfill the operational request and sending the spare 500 to storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Defined work&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="defined-work">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#defined-work" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>The &lt;em>Work Master&lt;/em> provides a set of resource specifications to do some work. It may be associated with segment.
When it is planned in a real job order, the work master is &amp;ldquo;cloned&amp;rdquo; as a &lt;em>Work Directive.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h4>Planned work&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="planned-work">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#planned-work" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Planned work broadly follows the following hierarchy:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Work Schedule.&lt;/strong> A schedule to perform some amount of work. The schedule contains one or more work requests.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Work Request.&lt;/strong> A collection of job orders to make something&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Job Order.&lt;/strong> An order to execute a specific part in a work request&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4>Performed work&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="performed-work">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#performed-work" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>The performance of a production run is queried through the &lt;em>job response&lt;/em>. This response exists in the following hierarchy:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Work Performance.&lt;/strong> A collection of work responses that detail the performance of the work done for some work schedule&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Work response.&lt;/strong> A collection of job responses that map to a work request&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Job response.&lt;/strong> The data about the real performance of a job order, including its start and end times and resource actuals.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2>Now you&amp;rsquo;re talking&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="now-youre-talking">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#now-youre-talking" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In this document, you&amp;rsquo;ve learned the basic vocabulary to discuss manufacturing according to a standardized model.
However, this is still an extremely brief entry into ISA-95, whose full standard has 9 parts and thousands of words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nevertheless, the best way to acquire a language is to practice it.
Can you think of how all the preceding terms apply to your manufacturing operation? Try to apply the terms with some colleagues!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ISA-95 as an ontology</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/explanations/isa-95-as-ontology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/explanations/isa-95-as-ontology/</guid><description>

&lt;p>No matter what you make, your manufacturing operation is going to use resources:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Without material, you can’t make anything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without equipment, you can&amp;rsquo;t transform material into a product.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without personnel, no one can run the equipment.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, resources are present everywhere in a manufacturing operation, and the resource models are present everywhere in ISA-95. When you define processes, you need to mention material. When you plan production, you need information about resource definitions and availability. When you execute production, you need to use resources. And when you collect data, you need a model to record what resources were used.&lt;/p>

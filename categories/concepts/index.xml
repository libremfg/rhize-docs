&lt;p>Rhize is a real-time, event-driven &lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/explanations/manufacturing-data-hub/" >manufacturing data hub&lt;/a>.
It unites data analysis, event monitoring, and process execution in one platform.
Its interface and architecture are designed to conform to your processes.
We assume nothing about what your operations looks like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rhize has only one strong opinion: all manufacturing objects and data must be modeled on the &lt;a href="https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-standards-committees/isa95" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISA-95 standard&lt;/a>.
This standards-based schema is how Rhize connects every data event across an entire operation.
If you aren&amp;rsquo;t an ISA-95 fan, we&amp;rsquo;re happy to convert you, but you must adopt it to use the platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if you do adopt ISA-95, you open your organization to Rhize&amp;rsquo;s far-reaching transformations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>A data hub for manufacturing&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="a-data-hub-for-manufacturing">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#a-data-hub-for-manufacturing" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Rhize is a data hub that collects, stores, integrates, and processes data from your manufacturing system.
Rhize accepts the &lt;em>event&lt;/em> as the driver of change in a manufacturing operation.
Its architecture is designed to receive and process message events emitted from the operation in real time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make each event coherent in the context of all others, the event object must conform to a standard.
Rhize uses the ISA-95 standard as its data model, and the database schema is the most complete digital representation of ISA-95 in the world.
The flexibility of ISA-95 scales to an entire enterprise operation, and future changes in processes require no ad-hoc changes of the schema.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The database represents data as a single graph, a structure ideally suited for the node and edge associations inherent in ISA-95.
The database is exposed through a single GraphQL endpoint.
Besides keeping the interface small, the GraphQL query language aligns exactly with the underlying graph model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The API is completely open. Your operators can use it as a backend to build any MES, MOM, and data-science applications they want.
Rhize also has a built-in low-code BPMN workflow creator, so operators can write logic to handle event data using only API calls and JSON transformation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rhize&amp;rsquo;s architecture supports distributed deployment, and its components are loosely coupled microservices.
This clustered approach is necessary for organizations to scale horizontally and maintain high reliability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>A tool that fits to your processes&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="a-tool-that-fits-to-your-processes">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#a-tool-that-fits-to-your-processes" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The development of Rhize is the culmination of decades of experience from real practitioners.
We know manufacturing is messy, and each process has thousands of particulars.
Even within the same company and segment, processes often differ from site to site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our design philosophy empowers manufacturing operators to shape their tool for their work demands.
Some examples of the flexibility include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A headless MES&lt;/strong>. While Rhize has a graphical interface, all data is reachable through a single API endpoint. This means your teams can rapidly build custom frontends―and do it with the most comfortable API for frontend development, GraphQL.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Low-code interface&lt;/strong>. Model your schema and execute processes using BPMN, a visual programming language. The visual interface makes Rhize and your manufacturing automation accessible to the widest possible audience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generic data collection&lt;/strong>. Rhize receives data from all levels of the manufacturing process. The &lt;a href="https://nats.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NATS&lt;/a> broker publishes and subscribes to low-level data from &lt;a href="https://mqtt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MQTT&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OPC-UA&lt;/a>, but the database can also receive ERP inventories and documents sent over HTTP.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/use-cases/" >Read about use cases&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Modern IT for manufacturing&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="modern-it-for-manufacturing">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#modern-it-for-manufacturing" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Rhize&amp;rsquo;s system design is flexible, practical, and built on modern tools and practices:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>All data is accessible through a single endpoint.&lt;/strong>
While the data collected and processed may span multiple segments, events, units, areas, and even plants, all data is stored in a graph database and exposed through a &lt;a href="https://graphql.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GraphQL&lt;/a> interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Automated and containerized deployment.&lt;/strong>
Rhize brings innovations from DevOps to manufacturing.
In practice, this means that Rhize is interoperable with whatever system the manufacturer uses,
deployment is version-controlled, and your system can use rolling upgrades with zero downtime.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Built on open standards.&lt;/strong>
Rhize is based on open standards, like ISA-95, and open protocols, like MQTT.
Open industry standards and protocols ensure that the application and your manufacturing processes speak a common language.
Rhize heavily uses open-source software, which brings interoperability, reduced vendor lock, and robust tooling ecosystems.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This article provides a high-level overview of how Rhize works, starting with data collection and ending with user interaction.
To make these concepts more concrete, the next section provides examples of each process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The heart of the Rhize platform is its manufacturing knowledge graph, which stores data from all levels of the operation and exposes this data through a single endpoint.
Around the database are services that exchange messages and process events in real-time.
The system runs on distributed, containerized systems, ensuring horizontal scalability and high availability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, outside of the Rhize deployment are the two most important components: the manufacturing operation, which sends event data to Rhize, and the Rhize users, who interact with Rhize data through a number of special-purpose interfaces.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Rhize&amp;rsquo;s architecture is event-driven, low-latency, and scalable.
To communicate events in real-time and across services, Rhize uses a publish-subscribe model through the NATS message broker.
The message infrastructure enables complex interaction between services without creating dependencies between them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Services in the Rhize application subscribe to their relevant topics and handle events as they come in.
Services also publish events to the event broker.
Thus, Rhize services can communicate with each other and with customer systems in a completely decoupled manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Data storage&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="database">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#database" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With a schema defined by the ISA-95 standard,
the graph database creates contextual relationships that link all data stored in the system.
This graph data, accessible through a single endpoint, provides a single source to perform vast combinations of analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along with event data from disparate places and decoupled services,
the database also stores declarative configuration data to instruct different services on how to respond to events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the time-series component of the database accepts real-time data streams.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>The interfaces&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="interfaces">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#interfaces" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Rhize application comes with a graphical interface.
Some uses include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/" >&lt;strong>Configure BPMN rules.&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> A low-code tool for analysts and operators to create programmable events.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/model/" >&lt;strong>Upload master data.&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> Based on the ISA-95 object models.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/" >&lt;strong>Administrate.&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> Authenticate and scope access to systems and personnel.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These interfaces sit on top of the GraphQL API gateway, which serves as a programming interface for data analysis.
Rhize customers also use the GraphQL interface to build their own applications, either with dedicated frontend developers or through low-code tools like Appsmith.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last but not least, the time-series data is observable through monitoring tools like Grafana.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Deployment&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="deployment">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#deployment" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Rhize runs on Kubernetes and is configured through CI/CD servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using Kubernetes, Rhize can deploy to multiple instances using a common configuration.
Such distribution removes single points of failure, and system upgrades can happen on a rolling basis, with zero downtime.
All deployment is version controlled, which makes regressions easier to recover from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Deployment is vendor neutral, giving organizations complete control to run the system on their local networks or preferred cloud host.
The modern tools of DevOps also makes the system easier to maintain, as they come with vast tooling ecosystems and training material.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Rhize works</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/versions/v3.0.3/get-started/how-rhize-works/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 19:39:39 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/versions/v3.0.3/get-started/how-rhize-works/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This article provides a high-level overview of how Rhize works, starting with data collection and ending with user interaction.
To make these concepts more concrete, the next section provides examples of each process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The heart of the Rhize platform is its manufacturing knowledge graph, which stores data from all levels of the operation and exposes this data through a single endpoint.
Around the database are services that exchange messages and process events in real-time.
The system runs on distributed, containerized systems, ensuring horizontal scalability and high availability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, outside of the Rhize deployment are the two most important components: the manufacturing operation, which sends event data to Rhize, and the Rhize users, who interact with Rhize data through a number of special-purpose interfaces.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>The ERP system, which subscribes to the &lt;code>maintenance&lt;/code> topic, prepares a document for maintenance personnel.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The Rhize agent collects data from MQTT brokers and devices, OPC-UA servers.
You can also send data and documents over HTTP through a &lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/versions/v3.2.0/how-to/gql/call-the-graphql-api/" >GraphQL call&lt;/a>.
The Rhize UI also has a graphical interface to &lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/versions/v3.2.0/how-to/model/" >model production&lt;/a> objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All this data is mapped to Rhize&amp;rsquo;s ISA-95 schema, which creates a coherent model for all objects in the data hub.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Rhize&amp;rsquo;s architecture is event-driven, low-latency, and scalable.
To communicate events in real-time and across services, Rhize uses a publish-subscribe model through the NATS message broker.
The message infrastructure enables complex interaction between services without creating dependencies between them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Services in the Rhize application subscribe to their relevant topics and handle events as they come in.
Services also publish events to the event broker.
Thus, Rhize services can communicate with each other and with customer systems in a completely decoupled manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Data storage&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="database">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#database" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With a schema defined by the ISA-95 standard,
the graph database creates contextual relationships that link all data stored in the system.
This graph data, accessible through a single endpoint, provides a single source to perform vast combinations of analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along with event data from disparate places and decoupled services,
the database also stores declarative configuration data to instruct different services on how to respond to events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the time-series component of the database accepts real-time data streams.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>The interfaces&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="interfaces">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#interfaces" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Rhize application comes with a graphical interface.
Some uses include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/versions/v3.2.0/how-to/bpmn/" >&lt;strong>Configure BPMN rules.&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> A low-code tool for analysts and operators to create programmable events.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/versions/v3.2.0/how-to/model/" >&lt;strong>Upload master data.&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> Based on the ISA-95 object models.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.rhize.com/versions/v3.2.0/deploy/" >&lt;strong>Administrate.&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> Authenticate and scope access to systems and personnel.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These interfaces sit on top of the GraphQL API gateway, which serves as a programming interface for data analysis.
Rhize customers also use the GraphQL interface to build their own applications, either with dedicated frontend developers or through low-code tools like Appsmith.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last but not least, the time-series data is observable through monitoring tools like Grafana.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Deployment&lt;span class="hx:absolute hx:-mt-20" id="deployment">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#deployment" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Rhize runs on Kubernetes and is configured through CI/CD servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using Kubernetes, Rhize can deploy to multiple instances using a common configuration.
Such distribution removes single points of failure, and system upgrades can happen on a rolling basis, with zero downtime.
All deployment is version controlled, which makes regressions easier to recover from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Deployment is vendor neutral, giving organizations complete control to run the system on their local networks or preferred cloud host.
The modern tools of DevOps also makes the system easier to maintain, as they come with vast tooling ecosystems and training material.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BPMN execution recovery</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/maintain/bpmn-nodes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/deploy/maintain/bpmn-nodes/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Rhize uses &lt;a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenIDConnect&lt;/a> to connect to a &lt;a href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keycloak&lt;/a> server to authenticate users and manage Role-based access controls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open ID Connect is a security architecture that uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to access secured resources.
JWTs are issued by Keycloak. Users can also be managed in Keycloak.
Or you can manage users in other services such as LDAP, Google, Azure AD, Facebook, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The general authentication flow is as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>When a user accesses the user interface, the UI redirects to Keycloak.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Depending on how it is configured, Keycloak redirects to the authentication provider so that the user can log in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the user is successfully authenticated, Keycloak redirects back to the user interface with an authentication code in the URL parameters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The UI calls a secure API to exchange the authentication code for a JWT.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The UI then uses that JWT to access secure APIs such as the Rhize GraphQL API.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The Rhize DB, libreBaas, has the public key from Keycloak, which can be used to verify the JWT.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Rhize uses &lt;a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenIDConnect&lt;/a> to connect to a &lt;a href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keycloak&lt;/a> server to authenticate users and manage Role-based access controls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open ID Connect is a security architecture that uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to access secured resources.
JWTs are issued by Keycloak. Users can also be managed in Keycloak.
Or you can manage users in other services such as LDAP, Google, Azure AD, Facebook, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The general authentication flow is as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>When a user accesses the user interface, the UI redirects to Keycloak.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Depending on how it is configured, Keycloak redirects to the authentication provider so that the user can log in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the user is successfully authenticated, Keycloak redirects back to the user interface with an authentication code in the URL parameters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The UI calls a secure API to exchange the authentication code for a JWT.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The UI then uses that JWT to access secure APIs such as the Rhize GraphQL API.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The Rhize DB, libreBaas, has the public key from Keycloak, which can be used to verify the JWT.&lt;/p>

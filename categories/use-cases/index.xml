&lt;p>In manufacturing, a &lt;em>genealogy&lt;/em> is the record of what a material contains or what it is now a part of.
As its name implies, genealogy represents the family tree of the material.
A material genealogy can help manufacturers in multiple ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Prevent product recalls by isolating deviations early in the material flow&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decrease recall time by having a complete record of where material starts and ends&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Help build reports and analysis of material deviations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create documentation and compliance records for material tracking&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Rhize provides a standards-based schema to represent material at all levels of granularity.
The graph structure of its DB has built-in properties to associate material lots with other information about planned and performed work.
This database has a GraphQL API, which can pull full genealogies from terse queries.
As such, Rhize makes an &lt;strong>ideal backend to use for genealogical use cases&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Electronic batch records</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/use-cases/ebr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/use-cases/ebr/</guid><description>&lt;div class="notices note" >

&lt;p>In pharmaceutical manufacturing, an &lt;em>Electronic Batch Record (eBR)&lt;/em> is a detailed report about a specific batch.
It includes information about items such as the process segments, material, personnel, and equipment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Rhize can ingest data from all levels of the manufacturing process, and do so in real-time, it is an ideal single source of truth to create eBRs.
The process can be automated and highly efficient.
Our experience in production systems shows that Rhize can typically generate an eBR in less than 500 milliseconds.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

Work calendars represent planned periods of time in your operation,
including shifts, planned shutdowns, or recurring stops for maintenance.
The Rhize API represents calendars through the `workCalendar` entity,
which has close associations with the {{< abbr "equipment" >}} and {{< abbr "hierarchy scope" >}} models.

Rhize also has a `calendar` service that periodically queries the Rhize DB for workCalendarDefinitions.
If it finds active definitions for that period, the service creates the work calendar entries and persists the data to a time-series database

{{< notice "note" >}}
Rhize's implementation of work calendars was inspired by ISO/TR
22400-10, a standard on KPIs in operations management.

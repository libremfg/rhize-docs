<h1 class="post-title">
The Rhize Manufacturing Data Hub
</h1>

Rhize is a real-time, event-driven manufacturing data hub.

Rhize unites all events from your manufacturing processes, relates these events as a single graph structure, 
and provides access to any combination of them through a single API endpoint.
The tight integration of all levels of manufacturing data, from real-time sensor data to operations orders, serves a wide variety of business needs, including as:

- **A manufacturing knowledge graph.** Help humans and algorithms analyze plant processes and discover places to optimize.
- **An integrator of systems.** Orchestrate processes across applications to standardize, coordinate, and transform data flows.
- **A backend for {{< abbr "MES" >}} applications.** Rapidly build frontends on top of the database and workflow engine.
  Design the MES system that makes sense for your processes and people.

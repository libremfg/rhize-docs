While Rhize has components that can replace an &lt;abbr title="Manufacturing execution system. A system in a manufacturing process that tracks and documents the transformation of raw materials to finished goods">MES&lt;/abbr>, historian, andon, and real-time monitoring solutions,
it can complement them just as well.
You can map data from an MES or &lt;abbr title="Enterprise resource planning. Software to manage business processes. In Rhize, ERP activities usually are named &amp;#34;operations&amp;#34;, where lower-level activities are prefixed with &amp;#34;Work&amp;#34;.">ERP&lt;/abbr> into the database, creating a coherent data model to unite your operations IT.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Genealogy</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/use-cases/genealogy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/use-cases/genealogy/</guid><description>&lt;p>This document provides a high-level overview of how to use Rhize for material genealogy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In manufacturing, a &lt;em>genealogy&lt;/em> is the record of what a material contains or what it is now a part of.
As its name implies, genealogy represents the family tree of the material.
A material genealogy can help manufacturers in multiple ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Prevent product recalls by isolating deviations early in the material flow&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decrease recall time by having a complete record of where material starts and ends&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Help build reports and analysis of material deviations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create documentation and compliance records for material tracking&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Rhize provides a standards-based schema to represent material at all levels of granularity.
The graph structure of its DB has built-in properties to associate material lots with other information about planned and performed work.
This database has a GraphQL API, which can pull full genealogies from terse queries.
As such, Rhize makes an &lt;strong>ideal backend to use for genealogical use cases&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Electronic batch records</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/use-cases/ebr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/use-cases/ebr/</guid><description>&lt;div class="notices note" >

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In pharmaceutical manufacturing, an &lt;em>Electronic Batch Record (eBR)&lt;/em> is a detailed report about a specific batch.
It includes information about items such as the process segments, material, personnel, and equipment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Rhize can ingest data from all levels of the manufacturing process, and do so in real-time, it is an ideal single source of truth to create eBRs.
The process can be automated and highly efficient.
Our experience in production systems shows that Rhize can typically generate an eBR in less than 500 milliseconds.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

Along with its API, Rhize also has a graphical interface to create and update objects in your role-based equipment hierarchy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Often, one object references another: for example, a piece of equipment may belong to an equipment class, have a unit of measure as a property, and be associated with process segment.

All these models are based on the ISA-95 standard, mostly from &lt;a href="https://www.isa.org/products/ansi-isa-95-00-02-2018-enterprise-control-system-i">Part 2&lt;/a>, which describes the role-based equipment hierarchy.&lt;/p>
